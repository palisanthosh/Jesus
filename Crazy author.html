    <p>Hi, I am Andrew a Tamil Catholic. When I get time, I will add more
    details about me.
  My first webpage is about Jesus, created in 2021 during the heights of
  coronavirus pandemic in India. But I wanted to create it in resume format.
You know, these days, even God needs good branding and marketing. (No He does not
not need it, of course, I know)
But countless people have died (literally, because the Government of India
heavily undercounts the death and infected figures) and many have lost hope (including me).

This is a reminder (or brand recall) for me and for all the others who have
lost hope.

I believe, if hope is lost, everything is lost. My webpage about Jesus is to rekindle
that hope in Jesus.

Please contact me <a href="Contact.html">here</a>
