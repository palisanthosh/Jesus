        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p> <em> <strong>Saviour</strong> of the world</em></p>
        <p> I am still relevant today in all areas of interest to you. I will never
          go obsolete. To make myself more relevant, I wanted to create a resume
          for myself. I consider everyone as my employer. Everyone can hire me and
          I can serve everyone at the same time. Try me at Wiki at least !! But I reckon
          there are better sources to know about me.
        </p>

        <p>

          <em>P.S. And the Wiki link I provided is the most unbiased I can be about myself.</em>

  <h3> Education</h3>
  <p> I owe my knowledge to
  <ul>
    <li> my Father in Heaven</li>
    <li> The Holy Spirit</li>
  </ul>
  On a funny note, we are all ONE and we continuously instruct and
  learn from each other &#128521. On earth, I learned enough to know about
  the prophets of old, to read from the Scriptures in the synagogue and
  to preach about the Kingdom of God. On numerous occasions, I am called
  Rabbi and Teacher </p>
  <hr>
  <h3> Hobbies </h3>
  Mostly my hobbies are centered on showing my love for others like
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm">Asking people to repent for their sins</a> and forgiving them</li>
    <li> Healing people with infirmities and possessed by unclean spirit</li>
    <li> Teaching them the value of love and Kingdom of Heaven</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
  <strong>Strengths</strong>
  <p>There's no limit to my strength as I am son of God even though I am son of
    man. If that is confusing, call me and I will answer you !!</p>
  <strong>Weaknesses</strong>
  <p>No weaknesses, seriously, whatsover. I am not boasting. If that makes you
    doubtful, as I said earlier, call me and I will answer you !!

    On second thoughts, I want to disclose that I am not a teetotaler. I drink
    wine when I break bread with my friends (many call them as my disciples)
    and I can make my own wine from water.

  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <p>
    I am sorry, I cannot exactly quote the year and mention what I did.
    <a href="https://christianity.org.uk/article/timeline-of-jesus-life">
      But I could definitely say what I did and where I did along with an approximate time period.
    </a>
    You might ask, why an approximate time period instead of the exact date. You know,
    I have been living since time immemorial, even before the Universe was born.
    For me, <a href="https://creation.com/2-peter-38-one-day-is-like-a-thousand-years">
      a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day </a> and I
    have a slight difficulty in converting my timeline to a normal human being's timeline.
